# GIPHY_Project
I made this project through UCLA's extension, and the aim was to learn to use AJAX and GIPHY's API. Note that I normally wouldn't put so many comments in my code, but I believe commenting when I'm a student is helpful, so I can know why I'm doing portions of the code through pseudo code.  
How to use it: click on the name of an artist and see 10 images populate the page. Click on any of the images and they turn into gifs. Click again and they are still again. You can also add your own artists to the list!
