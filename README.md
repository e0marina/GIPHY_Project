# GIPHY_Project
I made this project through UCLA's extension, and the aim was to learn to use AJAX and GIPHY's API. Note that I normally wouldn't put so many comments in my code, but I believe commenting when I'm a student is helpful, so I can know why I'm doing portions of the code through pseudo code.
